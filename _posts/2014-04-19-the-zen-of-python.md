The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```
##Beautiful is better than ugly.
* 追求美丽：美丽比丑陋好！
##Explicit is better than implicit.
* 追求直接：显示比隐式更好！
##Simple is better than complex.
* 追求简单：简单与复杂更好！
##Complex is better than complicated.
* 避免混乱：复杂比混乱更好！
##Flat is better than nested.
* 扁平化：扁平比网状结构更好！
##Sparse is better than dense.
* 追求稀疏：稀疏比密集更好！
##Readability counts.
* 追求可读性；
##Special cases arent special enough to break the rules.
* 坚持原则：特殊的case并不足以破坏规则！
##Although practicality beats purity
* 实用性与纯洁性优先级更高！
##Errors should never pass silently.
* 错误永远不能放过！
##Unless explicitly silenced.
* 除非显示禁用！
##In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
* 面对含糊时，杜绝去猜！
##There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
* 有且只有一种方法解决！
##Although that way may not be obvious at first unless youre Dutch.
* 尽管这种方法一开始不明显，除非你非常粗鲁；
##Now is better than never.
* 现在总比没有好！
##Although never is often better than *right* now.
* 尽管永远不会总比现在好！
##If the implementation is hard to explain, its a bad idea.
* 如果你的实现很难解释，那就是一个不好的实现！
##If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
* 如果实现解释起来很容易，那可能是一个好方法！
##Namespaces are one honking great idea -- lets do more of those!
* 名字空间是很好的方法，让我们多去利用它！
